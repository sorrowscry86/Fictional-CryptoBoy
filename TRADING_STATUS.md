## 🎯 Entry Signal Requirements

The strategy requires ALL of the following for entry:

1. **Sentiment > +0.3** (bullish news sentiment)
2. **RSI < 70** (not overbought)
3. **Volume > 1.5x average** (confirmation)
4. **Price above SMA(20)** (uptrend)
5. **Positive momentum** (technical confirmation)

**Current Status:** Bot is waiting for these conditions to align across monitored pairs.

---

## ⏰ Why No Trades Yet?

This is **completely normal** for several reasons:

1. **Timeframe:** 1h candles mean new signals only every hour
2. **Conservative Strategy:** Multiple confirmations required before entry
3. **Market Conditions:** Sentiment is slightly bullish (+0.15-0.18) but not strongly bullish (>+0.3 threshold)
4. **Risk Management:** Bot prioritizes avoiding losses over making quick trades
5. **Fresh Start:** Just loaded sentiment data 6 minutes ago

**Expected Behavior:** First trade could occur within 1-6 hours as market conditions evolve and new candles form.
